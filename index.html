    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Brazilian citizen, living in Eindhoven since April 2023, due to a job opportunity for my husband in a
        Dutch Company.<br>
        During this period, I have been dedicated to improving my English and have recently started studying Dutch to
        facilitate our integration into the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently studying <strong>Web Development</strong>, learning and improving hard skills that will enable me to enter the
        technology market. So far, programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript have been studied.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Brazil, I built a career in the legal field, which allowed me to develop skills such as responsibility,
        commitment, punctuality, attention to clients, and care and diligence in the activities assigned to me.
        Here in the Netherlands, I have been seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and also enable a
        greater and better adaptation.
